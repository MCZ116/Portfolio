This is small simple project written in Java. A little info below:
- It is created in Page Object Pattern so there are classes only for pages and tests.
- This project is using interface but it doesn't need to, it's only one method but well it is import one..
- If any test fails Listener will catch error and screenshot it. Listener is included in Base folder for now.
- Maven is used for dependencies.
- TestNG is used for managing tests instead of JUnit.
- It is possible to use testng.xml file in Jenkins.
- All tests are independent from each other.

Love to learn new things!
